# The Maze

The Maze is a first-person. horror game inspired by the likes of Slender and Amnesia. The player is equipped with nothing more than a flashlight to illuminate the entire maze in front of him. Monsters will chase him as he descends into the infinite labyrinth. Only with luck, skill, and cunning will he be able to escape.

## Setup

You can run the game using the following command in the dist directory:

```java
java -jar MyGame.jar
```

Building the source code tree is a little more complex, as it requires the JMonkeyEngine IDE. To do so, one needs to install the IDE, create a new project, which generates machine-specific build files and caches, and then copy the src and assets folders over to the new project. Then, simply use the IDE's run and build commands to generate the executable.
